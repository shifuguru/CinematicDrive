Cinematic Drive with Auto Pilot
by Shifuguru


Cinematic Drive with Auto Pilot is a complete re-write and enhancement of Hermes1312's original mod, "Red Dead Redemption 2 Cinematic Camera with Autopilot." With Hermes' permission, I have renamed, refined, and upgraded the script for better usability and discoverability.

This mod allows you to enable cinematic camera mode with black bars and automated driving to your waypoint or free roam cruising—just like in Red Dead Redemption 2! Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride with beautiful, immersive cinematic shots in GTA 5.
